# WhatColorIsIt
This is a simple digital clock which changes its colour, depending on the time of day. 
For that, it takes the current time, reads it as a hex-code and changes its background accordingly. 
It is heavily inspired by the project of the same name by scn9a.org, which was apparently taken down (which in turn was the reason I made this).
